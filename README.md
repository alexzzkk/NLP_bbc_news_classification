There are five natural classes within this dataset, namely business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech.

## Description of tasks
Based on this dataset, tasks such as data preprocessing, features selection, and training and evaluating of a machine learning model were performed to classify news articles.
In addition to that, below specific requirements were also 
- including at least three different features to train their model, one of them should be based on some sort of word frequency.
- performing feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of all features.

# Instruction
- Download the Jupyter Notebook Coursework report â€“ part 2.ipynb
- Download the zipfile named bbc.zip, make sure that this file is in the same folder as the Jupyerte Notebook.
- Open the jupyter notebook and run all the commands
- Note that some cells were commented out because it tooks relatively long time to execute. Be sure to remove the comment if execution is required.

# Requirement
Python version: 3.11.5 <br>
