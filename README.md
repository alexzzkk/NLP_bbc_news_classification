# Description

This repository contains a solution for tackling a text classification problem given bbc_news dataset using Python with Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Description of dataset
The dataset consists of 2,225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005.
There are five natural classes within this dataset, namely business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech.

## Description of tasks
Based on this dataset, tasks such as data pre-processing, features selection, and training and evaluating of a machine learning model were performed to classify news articles.
Additionally,
- Three different features were used to train the model, namely named entity recognition, TF-IDF, and paragraph embedding.
- Feature selection was performed to reduce the dimensionality of all features

# Instruction for execution
- Lauch Jupyter Notebook in terminal using the command line `Jupyter Notebook`
- Download the Jupyter Notebook `Coursework report – part 2.ipynb`
- Make sure the required Python libraries are installed
- Download the zipfile named `bbc.zip`, make sure that the unzipped folder is in the same folder as the `Coursework report – part 2.ipynb`
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all the commands
- Note that some cells were commented out because it takes relatively long time to execute. Be sure to remove the comment if you want to execute the code.
