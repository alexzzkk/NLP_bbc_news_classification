# Description

This repository was created for releasing the code for solving text classification problem given bbc_news dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Description of dataset
The dataset contains news articles split into five categories: tech, business, sport, politics and entertainment. 

## Description of tasks need to be performed
Based on this dataset, preprocess the data, select features and train and evaluate a machine learning model of their choice for classifying news articles.
- include at least three different features to train their model, one of them should be based on some sort of word frequency.
- can decide the type of frequency (absolute or relative, normalized or not) and text preprocessing for this mandatory word frequency feature. The remaining two (or more) features can be chosen freely.
- Then, students are asked to perform feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of all features.

# Instruction
- Download the Jupyter Notebook Coursework report â€“ part 2.ipynb
- Download the zipfile named bbc.zip, make sure that this file is in the same folder as the Jupyerte Notebook.
- Open the jupyter notebook and run all the commands
- Note that some cells were commented out because it tooks relatively long time to execute. Be sure to remove the comment if execution is required.

# Requirement
Python version: 3.11.5 <br>
Jupyter Notebook version: 6.5.4 <br>
